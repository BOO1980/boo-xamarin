    <ul><li>
        Xamarin is an open sourced platform for building modern and performant application for IOS, Android and Windows with <div class="NET"></div>
    </li>
<li>Xamarin is an abstraction layer that manages communication of shared code with underlying platform code</li>
<li>Xamarin runs in a managed environment that provides conveniences such as memory allocation and garbage collection</li>
<li>Xamarin enables developers to share an average of 90% of their application accross platforms</li>
<li>This pattern allows developers to write all their business logic in a single language (or use existing application code) but achieve native performance, look and feel on each platform</li>
<li>Xamarin application can be written on PC or Mac and compile into native application packages such as an apk file on Android or an ipa file on iOS</li></ul>
